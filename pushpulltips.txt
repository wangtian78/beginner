git status: compare specifc local branch and remote branch(local master vs master, local Hannah vs Hannah);

"push origin branchname" command will push local branchname to remote branchname, regardless which local branch you are in;

"pull origin branchname" command will pull remote branchname to your current local branch (even it is not "branchname");

so be careful about "pull" command.
